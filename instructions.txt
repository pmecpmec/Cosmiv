🎬 AI Highlight Editor — Project Overview
🔥 Vision

The AI Highlight Editor is a web application that automatically edits highlight videos from raw gameplay or media clips.
Users can upload a .zip folder containing their unedited clips (e.g. Counter-Strike, Valorant, IRL footage), and the system will detect highlight moments, apply an editing style, and render a complete video — all automatically.

In short:

“Upload raw clips → get a finished, stylized highlight video.”

🎯 Core Features
Feature	Description
🎞️ Upload ZIP of Clips	Users drag-and-drop a .zip with raw .mp4 / .mov clips.
🧠 AI Highlight Detection	Analyzes video + audio to find high-action or emotional moments (based on motion, sound peaks, faces, etc.).
✂️ Auto Scene Selection	Automatically selects the best scenes up to a target duration (e.g. 60 seconds).
🧩 Automatic Editing	Cuts, trims, adds transitions, and composes a coherent video.
🎵 Theme System	User can select a “theme” (e.g., Cinematic, Esports Fast-Cut, Chill Montage), affecting pacing, transitions, color grading, and background music.
🌈 Automatic Effects (future)	Integration with generative video tools like Runway / Pika / Sora for color grading, camera motion, or stylized effects.
🚀 Full Rendering Pipeline	Returns the final .mp4 video ready to share on YouTube, TikTok, or Twitter.
🧱 Architecture Overview
Frontend

Framework: Next.js (React)

Styling: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components

Functionality:

File upload with progress bar

Theme selector (dropdown)

Render job status view

Preview player & download link

Backend

Framework: FastAPI (Python)

Media Tools: FFmpeg, MoviePy

AI / ML Libraries: OpenCV, PySceneDetect, Whisper (optional), TorchVision

Job Queue: Redis + RQ or Celery (for async processing)

Storage: S3-compatible (AWS, DigitalOcean Spaces, or MinIO)

Database: PostgreSQL (user accounts, job tracking)

Pipeline Summary

Upload → Extraction: User uploads a ZIP of clips → server extracts to temp folder.

Transcode: Converts all clips to consistent format (H.264, 1080p, 30 fps).

Analysis:

Scene detection (PySceneDetect)

Audio peak detection (FFmpeg RMS energy)

Motion intensity (OpenCV frame differencing)

Optional: ASR with Whisper to detect emotional speech or commentary.

Scoring:

Combines audio + motion + optional face/activity presence.

Each scene gets a highlight score.

Selection:

Selects top scenes until target duration is reached.

Assembly:

Concatenates selected scenes, applies transitions, adds background music & LUT (color grade).

Optional overlays (logos, subtitles).

Export:

Renders final video with FFmpeg → returns downloadable MP4.

Themes:

Each theme changes pacing, transition types, color look, and audio mix style.

⚙️ Tech Stack
Layer	Technology	Purpose
Frontend	Next.js (React)	UI, upload, preview
Backend	FastAPI (Python)	Core API, routing
Worker	Celery / RQ	Async video jobs
AI / CV	OpenCV, PySceneDetect, Whisper	Scene & highlight detection
Media Engine	FFmpeg, MoviePy	Editing, rendering
Storage	AWS S3 / MinIO	File storage
Database	PostgreSQL	Users, jobs, metadata
Infra	Docker + Nginx	Deployment
Auth (later)	JWT or OAuth2	User sessions
🧩 Example Flow (User Perspective)

User visits the site → logs in (optional).

Uploads a ZIP with raw clips → selects theme “Cinematic” and sets duration to 60 s.

Backend extracts, analyzes, scores scenes, and assembles a 60 s highlight reel.

User sees job progress in dashboard → receives finished highlight.mp4.

(Optional) User applies generative effects (e.g., color grade or slow-motion from Runway).

📦 MVP (Step 1 — Local Prototype)

Upload .zip

Extract first video → detect scenes → score by audio + motion → pick top 60s → export

Built with:

FastAPI

MoviePy

OpenCV

PySceneDetect

FFmpeg

Returns highlight.mp4 directly in response

This MVP runs locally in VS Code using uvicorn.
It’s the foundation for later expansion (themes, async jobs, frontend, etc.).

🧠 Planned Next Steps

Background Job System

Offload heavy video analysis & rendering to workers (Redis + RQ/Celery).

Add job queue, status polling, and retry handling.

Multi-clip Handling

Analyze all uploaded videos instead of the first one.

Combine scenes from different files into one highlight.

Theme & Style Engine

Pre-built themes (Cinematic, Esports, Chill).

Each theme defines transition templates, pacing, music style, color LUT.

Frontend Integration

Build Next.js interface with upload progress and preview player.

User Accounts & Storage

Allow users to log in, save previous renders, manage files.

AI Enhancement Integration (Phase 2)

Hook into Runway / Pika / Sora APIs for AI-powered effects.

Add automatic captioning and camera movement generation.

Cloud Deployment

Dockerized services (frontend, backend, worker, Redis, DB).

Deploy on AWS / Fly.io / Render with persistent storage.

💡 Long-Term Vision

Allow creators, streamers, and gamers to upload hours of content and instantly generate highlight reels.

Eventually add editing intelligence — pacing, music syncing, captions, and motion graphics driven by LLM + CV models.

Make video editing as simple as describing the vibe:

“Make me a 1-minute cinematic highlight of my best Valorant plays, dark blue theme, high-energy music.”
