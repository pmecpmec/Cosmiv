## 🪐 Agent Prompt

You are an AI development assistant for **Cosmiv**, now adopting a **Space inspired, sleek, and futuristict / neon-cosmic aesthetic**.

Your task is to **audit the current project** (`frontend`, `backend`, `pipeline`) and create a **fully detailed Big Road** for development.

### Requirements:

1. **Identify all existing features** and mark which are **ready**, **in progress**, and **pending**, including:
   - AI video processing pipeline
   - OAuth integrations (Steam, Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo)
   - Weekly montage system
   - Subscription model
   - Analytics dashboard
   - Cosmic Orb AI assistant

2. **Update the style and UI** across the platform to the **Space inspired, sleek, and futuristict / neon-cosmic aesthetic**, including:
   - **Gradient palette:** Violet → deep blue → neon cyan, with **vibrant pink accents** (`#FF0080`, `#FF00FF`)
   - **Neon-glow buttons** with enhanced luminosity and sleek overlays
   - **Semi-transparent floating cards** with subtle cosmic effects
   - **Cosmic backgrounds** with space elements, scanlines, and neon overlays
   - **Motion effects:** Subtle parallax, chromatic aberration, and sleek transitions
   - **Space-themed tier names:** Cosmic Cadet, Nebula Knight, Creator+ (maintained)

3. **Maintain all Aiditor/Cosmiv functionality** while replacing old UI references with the new Space inspired, sleek, and futuristict aesthetic.

4. **Produce a Big Road markdown file** (`BIGROAD_COSMIC.md`) summarizing:
   - Complete feature list with statuses
   - Space inspired styling changes applied
   - Next development steps
   - Technical debt and improvements needed

5. **Output recommendations** for missing or future features, including:
   - Generative effects (Runway, Pika, Sora integration)
   - Natural language editing ("Make me a cinematic montage...")
   - Social integrations (TikTok, YouTube, Instagram direct posting)
   - Space-inspired UI enhancements (cosmic animations, sleek transitions)

6. **Keep documentation updated** in `PROJECT_STATUS_FOR_CHATGPT.md` with Space inspired styling notes.

### Space Inspired Style Guidelines:

**Visual Elements:**
- **Glitch Effects:** Subtle RGB channel separation on hover/transition
- **Scanlines:** CRT-style horizontal lines overlay (subtle, ~5-10% opacity)
- **Cosmic Planet:** Animated planet with sleek effects in cosmic background
- **Neon Glow:** Enhanced luminosity on buttons, cards, and interactive elements
- **Chromatic Aberration:** Red/cyan color separation on animations
- **Motion Effects:** Subtle parallax, floating animations, screen shake on interactions

**Color Additions:**
- **Glitch Pink:** `#FF0080` - For error states, glitch effects
- **Hot Pink:** `#FF00FF` - Accent color for neon highlights
- **Enhanced Neon Cyan:** `#00FFFF` - More intense glow
- **Broken Purple:** `#8B5CF6` with glitch overlay effects

**Typography:**
- Consider adding a **retro-futuristic font** for headers (optional: "Orbitron", "Rajdhani", "Exo 2")
- Maintain Inter for body text
- Add **text cosmic effects** on hover for important headings

### Output Format:

Create `BIGROAD_COSMIC.md` with the following structure:

```markdown
# Big Road: Cosmiv Space Inspired Edition

## ✅ Completed Features
[Feature list with status]

## ⚙️ In Progress
[Features being worked on]

## 📋 Pending / Future
[Features to be built]

## 🎨 Space Inspired Styling Updates
[Detailed list of style changes applied]

## 🚀 Next Steps
[Actionable development tasks]

## 💡 Recommendations
[Future features and improvements]
```

### Critical Notes:

- **Maintain functionality:** All existing features must continue to work
- **Style consistency:** Every UI element should reflect Space inspired, sleek, and futuristict aesthetic
- **Performance:** Cosmic effects should be optimized (CSS filters, not heavy JS)
- **Accessibility:** Ensure scanlines/effects don't hinder readability
- **Documentation:** Update `COSMIV_STORY.md` with Space inspired aesthetic details

**Output in Markdown**, clearly separating Completed, In Progress, and Pending features. Include style/branding notes for each section. Provide actionable next steps for Pedro to implement.
